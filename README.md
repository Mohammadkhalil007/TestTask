Problem 1: Asynchronous Operations

Create a function that takes in an array of URLs and downloads the contents from each URL using asynchronous methods. Once all downloads are complete, return an array with the downloaded contents in the same order as the URLs.

Problem 2: Error Handling

Design a function that fetches data from an API endpoint. Implement proper error handling to handle various HTTP status codes and network failures. Log appropriate messages for each type of error encountered.

Problem 3: File System Operations

Develop a utility that reads a directory and lists all files with a specific extension (e.g., .txt). Implement this functionality using Node.js's File System module.

Problem 4: Database Interaction

Create a simple REST API endpoint using Express.js that interacts with a database (can be any database of your choice). Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a specific resource (e.g., users, posts).

Problem 5: Authentication

Implement an authentication middleware using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in a Node.js application. Create endpoints that require authentication to access specific resources. Ensure proper token validation and handling of expired or invalid tokens.

All tasks are completed in this repo 
1: execution of async file give us the fetch data from apis and and return a complete array with fetched data 
also it give us the .txt extentions files as well which i have placed in files directory 


2: error handling and database connection and jwt is implemented in main.js 

when user insert data then a jwt token return this token will use when he will try to update his email
